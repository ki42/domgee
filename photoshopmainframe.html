Megan was first introduced to Paint and Draw in elementary school as something fun to make pretty pictures with. In her freshman year of college she was introduced to Adobe Illustrator and Photoshop in a graphic arts class. 
<br><br> She found that she could use the programs to design her business cards, and the earth logo you see all over geocities.com/goodfilmtechie . She then took a digital photography class, where she created most of the images you see here.     
<br><br>
<b> Her photoshop resume is as follows: </b>
